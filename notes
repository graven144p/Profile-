Research Notes


NuScale’s NPM is designed to complement renewable energy, not compete with it.

Their reactors provide reliable, dispatchable power that helps balance grid variability from solar and wind.

With passive safety systems NuScale supports a stable, flexible energy mix.

NuScale is using AI with ORNL to optimize 12-unit $SMR reactor configurations, 
reducing simulation times and lowering potential fuel costs. 
Cutting-edge nuclear engineering in action. 





PWR reactors are the backbone of modern nuclear, and companies like NuScale proved how far a compact PWR design can go with full NRC certification. Hadron Energy is taking that same proven foundation and pushing it into the next era. 

Smaller footprints, faster deployment, and higher resilience for defense and commercial use.

A PWR-based microreactor gives you what the market wants right now — water-cooled, highly stable, familiar to regulators, and already trusted by the nuclear industry.




NuScale’s $SMR technology is compatible with advanced fuels, keeping this sustainable option open for the future.

Responsible waste management is a cornerstone of sustainable nuclear energy. The methods used are not new or experimental. They are proven, regulated, and safe.




NuScale Power Modules (NPMs) can ramp their power output up or down depending on how much renewable energy (like wind or solar) is available at any given moment.





The NuScale/ORNL TEA study doesn’t list specific chemicals by name, but it focuses on chemical plants that require large amounts of process steam and electricity. In practice, this generally applies to industries like:
    •    Petrochemicals & refining – e.g., production of ethylene, propylene, ammonia, and other hydrocarbon derivatives.
    •    Fertilizers – especially ammonia (NH₃) and urea plants, which require high-temperature steam for synthesis.
    •    Industrial gases & basic chemicals – hydrogen, methanol, chlorine, caustic soda.
    •    Specialty chemicals & polymers – plastics, resins, and other high-volume industrial chemicals that need heat and electricity.

The key point is any plant that relies on high-temperature process steam (~400°C / 752°F) and substantial electrical power could integrate NuScale SMRs profitably.




Ammonia is essential to global food security — and today it’s also one of the most carbon-intensive chemicals produced. The reason isn’t chemistry, it’s energy. 

Nearly all ammonia emissions come from fossil-based hydrogen production. By coupling proven electrolyzers with reliable nuclear power from SMRs like NuScale’s, ammonia production can be fully electrified, 
continuously operated, and scaled without massive storage or intermittency risk.
For industrial commodities, reliability and utilization matter — and that’s where nuclear quietly outperforms.





BWXT BANR is currently in the lab, similar to NuScale NPM.

Doosan handles production, shipping reactors to deployment sites. 

BWXT is also a partner with NuScale, manufacturing key components for the NPM.

Technician and operator roles will become available as projects transition from lab to operational deployment.

Applicable to both commercial and military roles.









Putting solar directly where it’s needed—on homes, offices, and industrial roofs—makes energy use more efficient, reduces waste, and can pair with storage for maximum reliability.

I’m less excited about solar farms on fields. They take up land 



While the Sun provides virtually limitless energy, the development of small modular reactors (SMRs) and micro modular reactors (MMRs) on
Earth remains strategically important. 
These reactors are not intended to “compete with the Sun” but to advance nuclear technology

Larry Fink warns that rising US debt and interest costs could threaten the dollar. Kevin O’Leary emphasizes that energy and power are more valuable than BTC. 
Even if the dollar loses value or debt spirals out of control, people still need electricity.
That’s why investors are turning to tangible, long-term assets gold, uranium nuclear infrastructure like reactors, and companies like $SMR  
whose value comes from their reactors all considered nuclear goods with real-world, intrinsic value as a hedge against currency risk.




As $BWXT just announced, the future of space exploration is powered by fission reactors.

BWXT, a key partner for $SMR provides critical nuclear components for the NPM.

By combining NuScale and BWXT’s expertise, the foundation exists for future nuclear power systems in space





NuScale NPSM: modular nuclear for spaceships & stations

• Attachable & swappable

• Powers life support, propulsion & systems

• Incremental deployment in space




The U.S. is rewiring the nuclear supply chain — from fuel to reactors.

Uranium & enrichment were expected 

What stood out: NuScale was the only SMR company included — signaling reactors are now viewed as critical supply-chain infrastructure, not future tech.

Energy sovereignty = fuel and deployable reactors.



North American nuclear enters execution. Federal funding accelerates the full fuel cycle:
• Centrus ($LEU) – uranium enrichment
• NuScale ($SMR) – SMR deployment
• Energy Fuels ($UUUU) – uranium & fuel supply
• Canada Nickel ($CNC) – critical materials
• Eagle Energy Metals → $NUCLR – emerging nuclear platform

$2.7B DOE for enrichment | $800M to fast-track SMRs | energy security + AI-driven demand

Uranium, plutonium, thorium, and other radioactive materials can potentially be used as fuel in advanced reactors,
turning legacy stocks and byproducts into clean, reliable energy while reducing waste and supporting non-proliferation. 
Programs like the DOE Fuel Line program allow certain companies to safely recycle and repurpose these materials. 
Cold War plutonium, for example, could be reused as reactor fuel, converting weapons material into energy while supporting non-proliferation. 
Many of these fuels can sustain reactors for years before refueling.



Radioisotope power systems (RPS) have been quietly powering exploration for decades, from deep-space missions to remote planetary rovers.

These systems, which generate electricity from the decay of radioactive isotopes like Plutonium-238, provide reliable, long-duration power where solar or conventional sources aren’t feasible. Key highlights include:
 • Longevity: Decades of continuous operation, as demonstrated by Voyager 1 & 2.
 • Reliability: Power delivery in extreme environments, from Mars dust storms to shadowed lunar craters.
 • Innovation potential: Next-generation dynamic conversion systems promise higher efficiency and more compact designs.

As humanity pushes further into space, RPS will remain an essential technology enabling sustained exploration and scientific discovery.





One of Voyager Technologies’ notable projects is Starlab, $VOYG
a commercial space station being developed with partners like Airbus, Mitsubishi Corporation, and MDA Space. 
Starlab is designed to maintain a human presence in low-Earth orbit and to transition microgravity research from the ISS to the commercial sector. 
It will serve global space agencies and companies, supporting scientific and commercial activities in space. 
This project highlights Voyager Technologies’ commitment to advancing space infrastructure and technology.

Leveraging Linux in Advanced Reactors

Advanced reactors represent the next frontier in nuclear energy. While safety-critical operations rely on deterministic real-time systems, Linux—specifically Fedora—can support non-safety functions such as data monitoring, predictive analytics, and operator interfaces.

Implementing Fedora in these layers enhances operational insight, supports simulation and orchestration, and bridges emerging technology with next-generation nuclear systems.





NuScale Power Module Distribution (NPMD) — Lightweight, Fast, and Customizable $SMR

Imagine a custom Linux distribution tailored for NuScale’s Power Modules (NPMs) to handle non-safety layers: operator interfaces, predictive analytics, monitoring, and simulations.

By leveraging Linux and open-source software, NuScale could:
 • Reduce RAM and CPU usage, making software faster and more efficient
 • Fully customize the OS, adding only what’s needed for analytics, dashboards, and orchestration
 • Enhance flexibility and innovation, with reproducible builds and tailored security (SELinux/AppArmor)

This approach keeps safety-critical operations on FPGA/RTOS while enabling fleet-wide insights, AI-driven maintenance, and seamless digitalization.

Open-source Linux could give next-generation SMRs the operational agility and performance they need—lightweight, fast, and fully under NuScale’s control.

Automate routine tasks using cron or systemd timers for scheduled analytics, reporting, and maintenance checks—ensuring timely insights with minimal overhead
